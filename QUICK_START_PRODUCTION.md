# üöÄ Quick Start - Production Launch

## ‚ö° 5-MINUTE CRITICAL FIXES

### 1. Update app.json (MANUAL - I cannot edit this file)
Open `app.json` and change:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "GlowCheck",
    "slug": "glowcheck-app",
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.glowcheck01.app"
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.glowcheck01.app"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Secure Your API Keys (30 minutes)
**‚ö†Ô∏è YOUR KEYS ARE EXPOSED - ROTATE IMMEDIATELY**

See `SECURITY_ALERT.md` for detailed instructions.
