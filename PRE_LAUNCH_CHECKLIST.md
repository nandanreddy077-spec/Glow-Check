# üöÄ Pre-Launch Checklist for GlowCheck App

## ‚úÖ Database Setup
- [x] All tables created
- [x] Row Level Security enabled
- [x] Functions and triggers working
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Run `FIX_CONVERSION_ANALYTICS_SECURITY.sql` to secure the conversion_analytics view**

## üîê Security Issues (MUST FIX BEFORE LAUNCH)

### **CRITICAL: API Keys Exposed**
Your `.env` file contains real API keys that are now compromised. You MUST:

1. **Rotate ALL API Keys Immediately:**
   - [ ] Google Vision API Key (currently exposed)
   - [ ] OpenAI API Key (currently exposed)
   - [ ] Supabase Anon Key (currently exposed)
   - [ ] RevenueCat API Keys (currently exposed)

2. **Never commit `.env` to version control:**
   - [ ] Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (should already be there)
   - [ ] Remove `.env` from git history if committed
   - [ ] Use environment variables in production

3. **Secure Your Supabase:**
   - [ ] Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API
   - [ ] Reset your anon key
   - [ ] Update your `.env` file with new key
   - [ ] Enable RLS on all tables (already done ‚úÖ)

## üéØ Trial & Subscription Logic

### **Inconsistency Found:**
Your code has conflicting trial periods:
- App code (`SubscriptionContext.tsx` line 93): **7 days**
- Previous messages: **3 days** and **1 day**

**Decision needed:**
- [ ] Choose final trial period: ___ days
- [ ] Update `SubscriptionContext.tsx` line 93
- [ ] Update database default in `trial_tracking` table
- [ ] Update all user-facing messaging

### Current Trial Logic:
```typescript
// contexts/SubscriptionContext.tsx line 93
const startLocalTrial = useCallback(async (days: number = 7) => {
  // Default is 7 days - is this correct?
```
