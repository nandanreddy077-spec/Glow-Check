# Glow Check App - Complete Setup Summary

## What You Need to Add to Supabase

You have a comprehensive database schema, but you're missing some critical functions that the app is trying to call. Here's what you need to do:

### ‚úÖ What You Already Have
Your current Supabase setup includes:
- All necessary tables (profiles, subscriptions, trial_tracking, etc.)
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Basic functions (handle_new_user, has_active_subscription, etc.)
- Triggers for automatic updates

### ‚ùå What's Missing (Causing the Error)
The error "Failed to get subscription status: [object Object]" is happening because these functions don't exist:

1. **`get_user_subscription_status(user_uuid)`** - Called by SubscriptionContext to sync subscription status
2. **`start_trial_with_payment()`** - Called when user starts trial with payment
3. **`track_scan_usage()`** - Called when user performs a scan
4. **`can_perform_analysis()`** - Called to check if user can scan
5. **`get_trial_status()`** - Called to get detailed trial info

### üîß How to Fix

**Step 1: Run the Additional Functions**
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `supabase-functions-update.sql` (I just created it)
4. Copy all the SQL code
5. Paste it into the SQL Editor
6. Click **Run**

**Step 2: Verify It Worked**
Run this query in SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
AND routine_name = 'get_user_subscription_status';
```

If it returns a row, you're good! ‚úÖ

**Step 3: Test the App**
1. Restart your app
2. Try to log in
3. The error should be gone

## Your Current Flow (How It Should Work)

### 1. User Signs Up
- Trigger `handle_new_user()` creates:
  - Profile record
  - User stats record
  - Trial tracking record (with 0 scans used)

### 2. User Sees Start Trial Screen
- App shows: "Start 3-Day Free Trial"
- User must add payment method BEFORE trial starts
- Shows what's included:
  - 1 free Glow Analysis scan
  - 1 free Style Check scan
  - Free Glow Coach access

### 3. User Adds Payment & Starts Trial
- App calls `processInAppPurchase()` ‚Üí Apple/Google payment
- App calls `start_trial_with_payment()` ‚Üí Creates trial in database
- Trial tracking updated:
  - `trial_started_at`: NOW
  - `trial_ends_at`: NOW + 3 days
  - `analyses_used`: 0
  - `max_analyses`: 2 (1 glow + 1 style)

### 4. User Performs First Scan (Glow Analysis)
- App checks `can_perform_analysis()` ‚Üí Returns true (0/2 scans used)
- User takes photo and gets analysis
- App calls `track_scan_usage()` ‚Üí Increments to 1/2
- Results are shown (not blurred)

### 5. User Performs Second Scan (Style Check)
- App checks `can_perform_analysis()` ‚Üí Returns true (1/2 scans used)
- User takes photo and gets analysis
- App calls `track_scan_usage()` ‚Üí Increments to 2/2
- Results are shown (not blurred)

### 6. User Tries Third Scan
- App checks `can_perform_analysis()` ‚Üí Returns false (2/2 scans used)
- App shows premium paywall: "Unlock Unlimited Scans"
- User must upgrade to continue

### 7. Trial Ends (After 3 Days)
- If user didn't cancel: Subscription activates, payment charged
- Function `activate_subscription_after_trial()` runs
- User becomes premium with unlimited scans

### 8. User Cancels Before Trial Ends
- User goes to App Store/Google Play
- Cancels subscription
- Trial continues until end date
- No charge occurs
- After trial ends, user loses access

## Database Schema You Should Have

After running both SQL files, you'll have:

### Tables (11 total)
1. **profiles** - User profiles + subscription status
2. **subscriptions** - Active subscriptions from Apple/Google
3. **trial_tracking** - Trial usage tracking
4. **glow_analyses** - Beauty analysis history
5. **style_analyses** - Style analysis history
6. **skincare_plans** - Personalized skincare plans
7. **user_stats** - Gamification stats
8. **circles** - Beauty communities
9. **posts** - Community posts
10. **comments** - Post comments
11. **user_memberships** - Circle memberships

### Functions (12 total)
1. **handle_new_user()** - Auto-creates records on signup
2. **update_updated_at_column()** - Auto-updates timestamps
3. **has_active_subscription()** - Checks if user is premium
4. **is_in_trial_period()** - Checks if user is in trial
5. **increment_trial_usage()** - Increments scan count
6. **get_user_subscription_status()** - Gets full subscription status ‚≠ê NEW
7. **record_payment_method_added()** - Records payment added ‚≠ê NEW
8. **start_trial_with_payment()** - Starts trial with payment ‚≠ê NEW
9. **activate_subscription_after_trial()** - Activates after trial ‚≠ê NEW
10. **can_perform_analysis()** - Checks if user can scan ‚≠ê NEW
11. **track_scan_usage()** - Tracks scan usage ‚≠ê NEW
12. **get_trial_status()** - Gets detailed trial status ‚≠ê NEW

## Psychology & Conversion Tactics (Already Implemented)

Your app already uses these tactics to maximize conversions:

### 1. Payment Before Trial ‚úÖ
- Users must add payment method to start trial
- Creates commitment and reduces friction later
- Industry standard for high-converting apps

### 2. Limited Free Scans ‚úÖ
- Only 1 Glow Analysis + 1 Style Check in trial
- Creates urgency to upgrade
- Users experience value but want more

### 3. Strategic Paywall Placement ‚úÖ
- After 2nd scan, show premium paywall
- User is already invested in the app
- Higher conversion rate at this point

### 4. Trial Urgency ‚úÖ
- "Only X spots left today" banner
- Countdown timer showing trial time left
- Social proof ("12,847 women started this week")

### 5. Value Stacking ‚úÖ
- Show all premium features upfront
- Emphasize "unlimited" vs limited
- Before/after comparisons to show results

### 6. Pricing Psychology ‚úÖ
- Yearly plan shows "Save $8.88"
- Monthly price shown as "$8.25/month" for yearly
- "Best Value" badge on yearly plan

### 7. Risk Reversal ‚úÖ
- "Cancel anytime" prominently displayed
- "No charge for 3 days" messaging
- "Secure payment" badges

## What You DON'T Need to Add

You asked if you need to add anything else. Here's what you DON'T need:

### ‚ùå Stripe Integration
- You're using Apple/Google payments (correct approach)
- No Stripe needed for mobile apps
- RevenueCat handles payment processing

### ‚ùå Additional Payment Tables
- Your current schema is complete
- `subscriptions` table handles everything
- No need for separate payment_methods table

### ‚ùå Webhook Handlers in Database
- Webhooks are handled by your backend/RevenueCat
- Database just stores the results
- Current setup is correct

### ‚ùå Additional Trial Tracking
- Your `trial_tracking` table is sufficient
- Tracks everything needed
- No additional tables required

## Next Steps

1. **Run `supabase-functions-update.sql` in Supabase** ‚≠ê CRITICAL
2. **Test the app** - Error should be gone
3. **Test trial flow**:
   - Sign up new user
   - Start trial with payment
   - Perform 2 scans
   - Try 3rd scan (should show paywall)
4. **Monitor Supabase logs** for any errors

## Building .ipa and .aab Files

For building production apps, you need EAS Build (Expo Application Services):

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
```

### Build iOS (.ipa)
```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

### Build Android (.aab)
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

### Important Notes
- You CANNOT build .ipa/.aab files locally without EAS
- Expo Go doesn't support in-app purchases
- You need Apple Developer account ($99/year) for iOS
- You need Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time) for Android
- RevenueCat integration only works in production builds

## Summary

**Your database schema is 95% complete!** You just need to add the missing functions by running `supabase-functions-update.sql`. After that, your app will work correctly with:

‚úÖ Payment before trial
‚úÖ Limited free scans (1 glow + 1 style)
‚úÖ Strategic paywall after 2nd scan
‚úÖ 3-day trial with auto-renewal
‚úÖ Subscription tracking
‚úÖ Usage tracking
‚úÖ Premium features

The error you're seeing will be fixed once you add those functions. Everything else is already set up correctly! üéâ
