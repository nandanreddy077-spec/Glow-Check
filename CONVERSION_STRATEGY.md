# 🎯 Conversion-Optimized Trial Strategy

## Overview
This implements a **"Freemium Hook"** model designed to maximize subscription conversions through psychological principles and strategic friction points.

## 🧠 Psychology Behind the Strategy

### 1. **The Hook: Free Value First**
- **What**: 1 free scan per week
- **Why**: Users experience the "aha moment" without commitment
- **Psychology**: Reciprocity principle - users feel they've received value

### 2. **Strategic Friction: Time-Limited Results**
- **What**: Results visible for only 24 hours
- **Why**: Creates urgency and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)
- **Psychology**: Scarcity principle - limited access increases perceived value

### 3. **The Commitment: Payment Method Required**
- **What**: 7-day trial unlocked ONLY after adding payment
- **Why**: Psychological commitment increases conversion likelihood
- **Psychology**: Consistency principle - users who commit are more likely to follow through

### 4. **The Trial: 7 Days of Full Access**
- **What**: Unlimited scans, full features for 7 days
- **Why**: Builds habit and demonstrates full value
- **Psychology**: Endowment effect - users don't want to lose what they have

### 5. **The Conversion: Seamless Transition**
- **What**: Auto-renewal after trial (with clear communication)
- **Why**: Reduces friction at conversion point
- **Psychology**: Default effect - users stick with the default option

## 📊 Conversion Funnel
