## 💰 How This Makes Money

### The Retention Loop

**Month 1**:
- User gets their routine (initial value)
- Starts tracking progress and products (building database)
- Sees first weekly insight (ongoing value demonstrated)

**Month 2**:
- Has 8+ progress photos showing improvement
- Product library reminds them to repurchase
- Weekly insights show patterns (e.g., "Your skin is 20% better with 8+ hours sleep")

**Month 3**:
- Before/after comparison shows clear improvement
- Personal database has 20+ products reviewed
- User can't imagine managing skincare without the app
- Subscription renewal is obvious

### Why It Works
1. **Data Lock-In**: Users build valuable personal data they don't want to lose
2. **Visible Results**: Progress photos prove the value of continued subscription
3. **Ongoing Value**: Weekly insights provide continuous new information
4. **Product Management**: Saves money by tracking expiry and effectiveness
