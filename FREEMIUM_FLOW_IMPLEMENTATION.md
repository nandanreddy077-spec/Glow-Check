2. **Blurred Content** - Teaser of premium features
3. **Daily Scans** - Create habit during trial
4. **Early Upgrade** - "Cancel Trial & Pay Now" for eager users

### Psychology
- Give enough value to show worth (1 free scan)
- Create FOMO with blurred content
- Build habit with trial (2 scans/day for 3 days)
- Remove friction with trial (no immediate charge)
- Offer early upgrade path for committed users
