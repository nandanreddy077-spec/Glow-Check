## ðŸ“± How Payments Work

### User Journey:
1. **Free Trial (3 days)**: User gets full access to all premium features
2. **Trial Expiry**: User is prompted to subscribe
3. **Subscription Options**: Monthly ($8.99) or Yearly ($99)
4. **Payment Processing**: Handled by Apple/Google through RevenueCat
5. **Access Control**: Premium features locked/unlocked based on subscription status

### Technical Flow:
1. App checks subscription status on launch
2. RevenueCat handles all payment processing
3. Subscription status synced across devices
4. Automatic renewal handled by stores
5. Users can manage subscriptions through App Store/Play Store

## ðŸš€ Ready for Production Build

### For EAS Build (.aab/.ipa files):
1. Your app.json needs to be updated with production bundle IDs
2. Add `react-native-purchases` to dependencies for production builds
3. Configure EAS build profiles

### Current Limitations:
- Bundle ID in app.json still shows development slug (needs manual update)
- `react-native-purchases` not installed (will be added during EAS build)

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps for Store Submission:

1. **Update app.json** with production bundle ID: `com.glowcheck01.app`
2. **Create EAS project** and configure build profiles
3. **Build .aab and .ipa files** using EAS Build
4. **Upload to stores** with your configured credentials

## ðŸ’° Revenue Model:
- **Monthly**: $8.99/month with 3-day free trial
- **Yearly**: $99/year with 3-day free trial (17% savings)
- **Trial Conversion**: Users automatically charged after 3 days unless cancelled
- **Subscription Management**: Users can cancel anytime through store settings

Your app is fully configured and ready for production deployment!
