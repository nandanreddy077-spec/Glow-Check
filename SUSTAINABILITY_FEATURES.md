# GlowCheck Sustainability Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive features added to make GlowCheck a sustainable, long-term subscription app that provides continuous value to users beyond their initial routine.

## Problem Statement
**Challenge**: Users get their routine once and then cancel their subscription because they don't see ongoing value.

**Solution**: Transform GlowCheck from a one-time analysis tool into an ongoing beauty companion that tracks progress, provides insights, and adapts to user needs over time.
