- Notifications remind them of impending loss

### 2. **Scarcity** (Limited Spots)
- "Only 7 trial spots left today"
- Creates FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)
- Drives immediate action

### 3. **Social Proof** (Thousands Upgraded)
- "12,487 women upgraded this week"
- Validates decision through peer behavior
- Reduces purchase anxiety

### 4. **Reciprocity** (Free Value First)
- 48 hours of free access
- Complete analysis visible
- Users feel obligated to reciprocate

### 5. **Commitment & Consistency**
- Once they see results, they're invested
- Tracking progress creates habit
- Hard to abandon invested time
